Project:  Project 5-Personal Web Site-Visitor Form Validation-Refactor JS

I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student,
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.

Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): This project of them all was the most difficult one so far for me. I think this is mainly due to
the scope of the changes being made, and just the size of the project overall. I really appreciated how the project started with
a refactoring with JS, because that caused me to refactor everything a bit. Which definitely made things easier.
