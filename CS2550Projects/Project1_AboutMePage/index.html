        <p>I want to go into Game Development, so here is a Haiku about games and game dev.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>One of my personal interests is Game Development. I have always been really
            fascinated with game dev. Right now I am getting into Graphics Programming specifically,
            which is really cool. Learning how things that are represented by numbers can be rendered
            to the screen, and stylized is very interesting.</p>
        <p>Another one is Reading. When I am not spending time with someone, or working
            on something, you will always find me listening to an audiobook. Recently
            I have been listening to a book series called The Wandering Inn, by a self&#8209;published
            indy author who goes by Pirateaba. They are very long, and there are 60 of the books planned.</p>
        <p>A third passion that I have been getting into recently is pickle ball. It is a sport that has
            been getting more and more popular recently, and I was caught in that wave. It is a very easy
            sport to get into, and all ages can play it. I mostly prefer to play casual, but it can get very
            competitive and fun with the right people.</p>
