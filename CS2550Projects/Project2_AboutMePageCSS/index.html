            <h2>Coded Worlds</h2>
            <p>I want to go into Game Development, so here is a Haiku about games and game dev.</p>
            <p class="center-poem"><em>Weaving fantasy<br>
                Players journey through crafted realms<br>
                Joy in every frame</em></p>

            <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>One of my personal interests is Game Development. I have always been really
                fascinated with game dev. Right now I am getting into Graphics Programming specifically,
                which is really cool. Learning how things that are represented by numbers can be rendered
                to the screen, and stylized is very interesting.</p>
            <p>Another one is Reading. When I am not spending time with someone, or working
                on something, you will always find me listening to an audiobook. Recently
                I have been listening to a book series called The Wandering Inn, by a self&#8209;published
                indy author who goes by Pirateaba. They are very long, and there are 60 of the books planned.</p>
            <p>A third passion that I have been getting into recently is pickle ball. It is a sport that has
                been getting more and more popular recently, and I was caught in that wave. It is a very easy
                sport to get into, and all ages can play it. I mostly prefer to play casual, but it can get very
                competitive and fun with the right people.</p>
